## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

Found something that doesn't work as expected? Search the [issue tracker](../../issues) for both open and closed issues first. Your bug may already be known or fixed. If nothing relevant comes up, open a new issue and include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A concise description of the problem and what you expected to happen instead.
- Reliable steps to reproduce the issue.
- Your environment: OS, .NET version, the version of Sdl3Sharp.Ffi you encountered the issue with, and anything else that seems relevant.
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or code snippets.

### Suggesting features

Have an idea for something new or an improvement to existing behavior? Search the [issue tracker](../../issues) for both open and closed issues first, in case it has already been discussed. If nothing relevant comes up, open a new issue and include:

- What you would like to see and why it would be useful.
- Any alternatives you have considered.
- Rough thoughts on how it could be implemented, if you have them.

### Submitting changes

Ready to contribute a fix, improvement, or new feature? Search the [issue tracker](../../issues) for both open and closed issues first. For anything substantial, consider opening an issue before writing code so the direction can be discussed. Once you are ready:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.
2. Make your changes, keeping the scope of the pull request focused on one logical change.
3. Open a pull request against the `main` branch. The pull request, as well as any related issues, should be well structured and detailed enough for a reviewer to understand what changed and why. Include a reference to any related issue where applicable.

## Guidelines for contributions

### Coding conventions

This project is written almost entirely in C#. There are no strictly enforced style rules, but please orient your code around the [Microsoft C# identifier naming conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names) and the [Microsoft C# coding conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) as a baseline.

A few things to keep in mind:

- Private fields use the `m` prefix (e.g., `mSomeField`).
- Code should be easy to follow for an onlooker. Avoid unnecessarily obscure constructs.

### A note on AI-assisted contributions

The use of AI tools, including LLMs and other AI-driven code generation tools, is **permitted**.

**For code contributions**, every individual contribution that was produced with the help of AI, fully or partially, must be clearly marked as such, for example in a code comment near the relevant section. Please also indicate the degree of AI involvement, for example `// 100% AI-generated`, `// AI-assisted`, or `// AI-suggested, heavily modified`.

**For non-code contributions** such as documentation, AI use does not need to be noted on a per-contribution basis. If you routinely use AI for such contributions, please make that known somewhere, for example in your pull request description, and give a rough sense of how much your contributions rely on AI.

In either case, contributions that appear to be derived from sources with licenses incompatible with this project's [MIT License](LICENSE.md) will not be accepted.
